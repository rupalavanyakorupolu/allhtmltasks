<h1>SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>
<h2>social media</h2>
<p>Social media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities, Classmates.com, and SixDegrees.com.[18] While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it "the very first social networking site".[18][19] The platform's name was inspired by the "six degrees of separation" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[20]

In the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.[21]

Research from 2015 reported that globally, users spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[22] likely fueled by the availability of smartphones.[23] As of 2023 as many as 4.76 billion people used social media[24] some 59% of the global population.</p>
<h2> mobile social media</h2>
<p>Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as phones and tablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location.</p>
<h2> platform convergence</h2>As an instance of technological convergence, various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope, increasingly overlapping with each other.

Examples are the social hub site Facebook launching an integrated video platform in May 2007,[42] and Instagram, whose original scope was low-resolution photo sharing, introducing the ability to share quarter-minute 640Ã—640 pixel videos[43] (late extended to a minute with increased resolution). Instagram later implemented stories (short videos self-destructing after 24 hours), a concept popularized by Snapchat, as well as IGTV, for seekable videos.[44] Stories were then adopted by YouTube.[45]

X, whose original scope was text-based microblogging, later adopted photo sharing,[46] then video sharing,[47][48] then a media studio for business users, after YouTube's Creator Studio.[49]

The discussion platform Reddit added an integrated image hoster replacing the external image sharing platform Imgur,[50] and then an internal video hosting service,[51] followed by image galleries (multiple images in a single post), known from Imgur.[52] Imgur implemented video sharing.</p>
